# An Analysis of Stock Options

Analysis of a selection of stack data from 2017 and 2018 to investigate investment options

# Overview

Steve's parents are interested in investing in stocks for green energy companies, specifically *DAQO New Energy Corp*. Steve is also looking to diversify his parents investments in other green energy companies. After creating end-user friendly analyses for DAQO stocks as well as the other stocks for the two years of data, Steve is looking to expand the dataset to more stocks over more years. This requires a refactoring of the VBA code, as detailed below.

# Results

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## 2017 Stock Performance
-Overall good performance, most stocks were in the green

In 2017, most stocks had increases in yearly returns. Some stocks, like DAQO, had returns of almost 200%, while only TERP had a negative return.
